title: Hello! Does this still work?

I've not added any new blog posts in quite a while - and I guess that's fine.
When I first started this I intended to write semi-frequently, and maybe the
second best time to start doing that is now.

I'm very surprised that the static generator I use still works across multiple
major versions with minimal effort: amazing work by the developers. I was not
all that happy about using a relatively heavy generator based on nodejs when I
set out, but it has somehow worked out.

Given a do ever, I'll probably make this uglier and simplier, with a release
process directly from Github actions or such. Turns out, having to manage
dependencies, clone this repo, writing locally, re-generating and pushing is far
too much to ask for on a semi-regular basis.
